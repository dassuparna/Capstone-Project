# Capstone-Project
In this Capstone Project, I have studied the key factors of the World Happiness Index published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. I have used machine learning algorithms and data visualization to explore how these factors correlate to the happiness index.
The thesis contains the following:
•	This Project Report 
•	The Machine Learning algorithms
•	Data Visualizations
•	Datasets used

The data is collected from the public domain for analysis.

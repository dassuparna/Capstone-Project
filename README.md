# Capstone-Project
In this Capstone Project, I have studied the key factors of the World Happiness Index published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. I have used linear regression algorithms and data visualization to explore how these factors correlate to the happiness index.


The data is collected from the public domain for analysis.

To run the model, keep the Happiness.ipynb file in the Python's current working directory and the datafiles under the subdirectory names NewData under the Python's current working directory.
